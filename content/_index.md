## **What is Prooftoys?**

> Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.  -- Leonardo da Vinci

Prooftoys is software and a set of resources for applying mathematical
reasoning.

It has been designed to be **approachable for beginners**.  You won't
need a background in mathematics or logic.  The **graphical user
interface** will work with you to:

- **construct correct proofs** with no holes and no handwaving, and
- **solve math problems** through proof.

Reasoning in Prooftoys is based on principles from basic algebra.  These
same principles extend to higher mathematics as well.

### **Ways to start**

</a>
{{% /divstyle %}}

- ***Pictures:*** The [***logic through pictures***]({{< relref
"/logic-pix-intro.md" >}}) section introduces some universal basics
of logic.  These are interactive diagrams with explanation, and truth
tables to support your intuitive sense of concepts such as *and*,
*or*, *not*, and *implies*).

- ***Hands on:*** with an extensive
  and self-contained [***Natural Numbers Game***]({{< relref
  "/number-game/tutorial1.md" >}}) tutorial that takes you
  step-by-step through proofs of important properties of numbers
  starting from a small handful of fundamental principles.  This
  includes background, hints, and tips for taking on its challenges

  [**Logical puzzles**]({{< relref "/hands-on.md" >}}) illustrate
  principles of proof, with a potential surprise or two.

  [**Basic algebra problems**]({{< relref "/hands-on.md" >}}) solved
  through proof.  Your steps will be mathematically correct.

- ***Documentation:*** Read about [***the mathematics and the
system***]({{< relref "/documentation.md" >}}). Watch a video
demonstration of the Prooftoys [**proof builder**]({{< relref
"/proofbuilder.md" >}}).

### **Why try it?**
{{% /summary %}}

- Build your skills and develop your understanding of rock-solid
  reasoning.

- Grow your appreciation of the power of reasoning from fundamental
  principles.

- Demonstrate solving traditional school math problems through proof.

#### How?

**User interface.** Prooftoys works entirely through a Web-based
point-and-click graphical user interface.  Most things you do are
based on suggestions based on your selection of a step or expression.
It lets you change your mind as much as you like, encouraging you to
"play around" with your proofs.

**Simplicity.** The logic used by Prooftoys has also been chosen
specifically to be useful to beginners.  For example its single rule
of inference is just a modest generalization of what is taught in any
high school course in basic algebra.

Statements in the logic are simply formulas with constants, variables,
and functions.  Prooftoys reduces the number of concepts to a minimum,
with just a little automation for convenience.  There is no need to
learn a separate proof language with its own syntax and vocabulary.

**Flexibility.** Prooftoys is as well-suited to solving problems as to
proving theorems.  For example it easily works backward from the
statement of a theorem or forward from the givens of a problem.

**Familiarity.** Prooftoys works to present its mathematics in
familiar, textbook-like style.  Proofs show up in a familiar textbook
style as a list of proved statements, each derived from the ones
before it.

**Transparency.** Prooftoys makes the details of every step in every
proof available in the proof builder and all proof displays.  A click
lets you drill down into the details of any step, to any depth.

**Resources.** With this website you can see how proofs are done or
learn about the ideas behind the logic to build your skills and
confidence in solving mathematical problems through proof.

**Prooftoys is for learning.** If you need more power or larger scale,
you should look at more established proof assistant systems, which
support:

- Large collections of theorems
- Editing entire mathematical theories
- Strong automation

The [Prooftoys](http://prooftoys.org) website and its software are
ongoing experiments in creating computer aids to help human beings do
mathematics.  Its knowledge of mathematics is quite limited, but we
aim to grow it as users advance.

### **The Prooftoys Vision**
{{% /summary %}}

On the one hand, Prooftoys is for learning **core ideas** of
mathematical proof, general **concepts of reasoning** rather than
cookbook procedures, in a way that is approachable to ordinary people.

In a larger sense though, Prooftoys is an effort to find better ways
to learn these great ideas in our modern era.  Far too much of math
education is still about people doing procedures that may have been
useful three hundred years ago, but pointless to do by hand now.

Computers can do the procedures for us, but without the concepts
we are still lost.  Luckily, there are now powerful systems of
mathematical reasoning that are based on simple principles used
throughout ordinary high school mathematics, and Prooftoys uses
one of these for all of its reasoning.

Prooftoys is an example of a new way of introducing mathematics where
the computer does things it is very good at, and human beings learn
concepts and key ideas.  It also aims to do this in a way that is
stimulating and interesting, not boring and a waste of time.  It is
the result of ongoing experimentation, and will evolve based on the
experience and input of people like you.

Even the specialized Prooftoys procedures (a.k.a. "tactics") for
working with real numbers are works in progress, not finished
products.

## What is deductive reasoning?

Deductive reasoning starts with true statements, or at least ones
taken as hypothetically true, and follows precise rules to reach
conclusions that we take to be clear consequences of those initial
statements.  Mathematical reasoning, as in mathematical proof, is the
quintessence and the epitome of deductive reasoning.

Much as mathematics is an essential building material for science,
mathematical reasoning is an essential building material for
mathematics, that makes it possible to build sturdy mathematical
structures that reach all the way "**<a target=_blank

beyond!</a>**"

### Why deductive reasoning?

Proof -- deductive reasoning -- is a cornerstone of mathematical
thinking.  So if mathematics applies to something you are trying
to do, you probably need skills in deductive reasoning.

Deductive reasoning is also key to solving a tremendous variety
of problems that can be stated precisely.  The problem could
be practical, or just entertainment for your brain.

The "Mutilated chessboard problem" is a fun one.

Here is a sample, a problem is from the book "My Best Mathematical and
Logic Puzzles" by the legendary <a target=_blank
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner">Martin
Gardner</a>, author of numerous books of entertaining and puzzling
mathematics and, for 25 years, the Mathematical Games column in
Scientific American magazine.

This is problem 20 in the book, a little mathematical parlor trick.
