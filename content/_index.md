<h1><b><b style="float:right">(Prove It)</b><b>(Yes You Can)</b></b></h1>

Welcome to the home of the **Prooftoys** online tool for learning math
and exploring mathematical reasoning.  The system and this site lets
you explore these subjects in multiple ways.

With Prooftoys you can *view and study completed proofs*. This
website contains "live" displays of many of them, like this:

   width="478" height="222">}}

Some are proofs of basic facts about *numbers*, derived from classic
axioms.  Others are useful theorems of *pure logic* that can apply to
any field of math.  You can view the facts and their proofs, which are
all worked out rigorously and computer-verified.  If a step is not
clear, you can "drill down" into the details, all the way down to the
most basic axioms and inferences.

This site also aims to help you *understand the concepts* at work in
mathematical logic and the Prooftoys system, with interactive
pictures resembling this:

Prooftoys can also help you *build and remember your own proofs*.

The core system is proudly free and open source software, hosted on <a
href="http://github.com/crisperdue/prooftoys" target=_blank>
GitHub</a>.

### Which way from here?

- Basic logic through [**pictures**]({{< relref "/logic-pix-intro.md" >}}).
- [**Concepts**]({{< relref "/2-prooftoys-logic-concepts.md" >}})
  of the Prooftoys logic.
- The logical [**language**]({{< relref "/language-intro.md" >}})
  of Prooftoys.
- The [**rules of the game**]({{< relref "/inference.md" >}})
  as played with Prooftoys.
- Proved facts about [**the real numbers**]
  ({{< relref "/real-number-facts.md" >}}).
- Key theorems of [**pure logic**]
  ({{< relref "/logical-axioms-and-theorems.md" >}}).
- For the boldest, dive into *building your own proofs* with the
  [**proof builder**]({{< relref "/proofbuilder.md" >}}).  This tool
  has some rough edges still, though it will only do correct
  inferences.
- For a somewhat more finished version of the proof builder, try
  the version targeted for solving simple equations, at the
  companion [Mathtoys](http://mathtoys.org/) site.
