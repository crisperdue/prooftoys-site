### Mastering math

*Would you like to master the art of mathematical thinking?*

Much as mathematics is an essential building material for science,
mathematical reasoning is the essential building material for
mathematics, that makes it possible to build sturdy mathematical
structures that reach all the way **<a target=_blank

Beyond!"</a>**

*But math can also be entertainment, the ultimate puzzle, the
perfect game for your mind.*

Mathematical reasoning is at the heart of mathematical thinking.  With
this website you can see how it is done, building your skills and
confidence in solving mathematical problems through proof.

*With luck, you might even begin to see how mathematics can be
something amazing and wonderful, even fun!*

### Prooftoys

Prooftoys is a computer tool that works with you interactively to
solve math problems -- or prove mathematical statements.  It has
correct rules for reasoning built into it, always follows them, and
never makes a careless mistake or forgets its rules.  You give the
orders, and it takes care of the details.

Working problems is a natural way to learn mathematical reasoning, and
Prooftoys has been designed especially to do precise reasoning, but in
an especially simple way.  You can always dig into the solution of any
problem and any proof to see exactly how it was done.

Here is a problem from the book "My Best Mathematical and Logic
Puzzles" (page 10) by the legendary <a target=_blank

Gardner</a>, author of numerous books of entertaining and puzzling
mathematics and, for 25 years, the Mathematical Games column in
Scientific American magazine.

#### Try this: the problem of the repetitious number

In this parlor trick you ask *spectator A* to write down any three-digit
number, then to copy the number to a new piece of paper, followed by
the same digits again, making a six-digit number.  Without looking,
instruct *spectator A* to pass the paper to *spectator B* without
revealing the number to you.

*Spectator B* is to divide the resulting number by 7, and then pass the
result to a *spectator C*, who divides the result by 11. (Tell them not
to worry, there will be no remainder!)

*Spectator C* passes it to yet one final spectator.  This last
spectator is to divide the result by 13 and then read the resulting
quotient.  The result will be the original three-digit number.

**Problem:** Prove that this trick always works regardless of the
initially-chosen number.

**Hint:** The key to solving this problem is finding a simple
mathematical statement of it.
