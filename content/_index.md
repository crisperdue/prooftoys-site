## Prooftoys

Much as mathematics is an essential building material for science,
logic and proof are essential building materials of mathematics.  They
make it possible to build sturdy mathematical structures that reach
all the way **<a target=_blank

Beyond</a>**!  Math can also be great entertainment, the ultimate
puzzle, the ultimate game for your mind.

Prooftoys is a computer tool that works with you interactively to
solve math problems -- or prove mathematical statements.  It has
correct rules for reasoning built into it, always follows them, and
never makes a careless mistake or forgets its rules.  You give the
orders, and it takes care of the details.

Working problems is a natural way to learn mathematical reasoning, and
Prooftoys has been designed especially to do precise reasoning, but in
an especially simple way.  You can always dig into the solution of any
problem and any proof to see exactly how it was done.

Here is a problem from the book "My Best Mathematical and Logic
Puzzles" (page 10) by the legendary Martin Gardner, author of numerous
books of entertaining and puzzling mathematics and, for 25 years, the
Mathematical Games column in Scientific American magazine.

#### Try this: the problem of the repetitious number

In this parlor trick you ask *spectator A* to write down any three-digit
number, then to copy the number to a new piece of paper, followed by
the same digits again, making a six-digit number.  Without looking,
instruct *spectator A* to pass the paper to *spectator B* without
revealing the number to you.

*Spectator B* is to divide the resulting number by 7, and then pass the
result to a *spectator C*, who divides the result by 11. (Tell them not
to worry, there will be no remainder!)

*Spectator C* passes it to yet one final spectator.  This last
spectator is to divide the result by 13 and then read the resulting
quotient.  The result will be the original three-digit number.

**Problem:** Prove that this trick always works regardless of the
initially-chosen number.

**Hint:** The key to solving this problem is finding a simple
mathematical statement of it.
