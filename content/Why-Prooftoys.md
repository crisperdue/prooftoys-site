# Why Prooftoys

(Writing in progress.)

Prooftoys is the computer-based
deductive system with an overriding design goal to be as easy
and helpful as possible for
a human being learning logic or mathematics or both, while also being
a flexible and practical system for doing simple mathematical proofs.

## Key points

* Instant availability from any Internet-connected computer

* Highly responsive user interface

* Friendly to high-school mathematics

  * Solution of formal high-school math problems is based heavily on rewriting;
    and Prooftoys directly supports this kind of rewriting.

  * Ground-up support for selecting terms by pointing and selection in the UI

  * Offers suggestions by matching selections with relevant rules

* Natural transition from rewriting as informally taught at high-school level
  to precise, general, and useful reasoning.

* User experience designed to minimize the need for memorization of
  quantities of inference rules and/or theorems.

* The logic has been chosen to provide as short and straightforward path
  as possible to the facts needed to work with real numbers and functions
  on real numbers.

* Presents the logic with a minimum of technical notation (e.g. type qualifiers
  on variables), avoiding highly technical concepts such as proper classes
  and nontrivial transformation of the surface language into an underlying logic.

* Uses mathematics that is as close to textbook descriptions as possible.
  For example Prooftoys presents real numbers with a predicate rather than
  a type in a type theory, and division by zero does not result in a real number.
