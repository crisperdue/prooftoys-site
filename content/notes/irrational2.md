## The square root of 2 is not rational

The ancient Greeks were very familiar with fractions, and the
Pythagoren Theorem proves that some lengths are determined by square
roots.  For example in a right triangle with sides A and B, and
hypoteneuse (the long side) C, the length of C is
`sqrt (a ** 2 + b ** 2)`.  So if sides A and B both have length 1,
the length of side C is `sqrt 2`.

According to one legend, the discoverer of this fact made his
discovery while out at sea, and "was subsequently thrown overboard by
his fellow Pythagoreans" for [disproving one of their
doctrines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number#Ancient_Greece).

### Cool nonconstructive proofs

#### There exists an irrational number that when raised to an irrational power, results in a rational number

From https://emilygorcenski.com/post/a-remarkable-tiny-proof/.

Proof

Consider \(\sqrt{2}\), which is irrational. Then, \(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\) is either rational or irrational. If it is rational, then we are done. If it is irrational, then consider \(\left(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}^2 = 2\).

#### Nim

There is a nonconstructive proof that one player can always win with a "strategy-stealing" strategy.
