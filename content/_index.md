## **What is Prooftoys?**

Prooftoys is a resource for learning the principles of **logic** and
**proof**, tailored specifically for beginners, who may have little
background in mathematics and no background in formal logic.  Its goal
is to be a more enjoyable and rewarding road to learning and applying
these powerful tools.  It includes an embedded **proof builder** tool
to help you construct real proofs.

### **Get introduced**

{{% divstyle style="float: right; xmargin: 2em 10% 0 10%" %}}
<a href="{{< relref "/logic-pix-intro.md" >}}">
{{< figure src="/images/logic-circles.png" alt="sample logic graphic"

</a>
{{% /divstyle %}}

* ***[Study the pictures]({{< relref "/logic-pix-intro.md" >}})***
that introduce basic "boolean" logic.  These are basically Venn
diagrams with explanation, and truth tables.  This is a point of view
on the use of "propositional" logic (e.g. *and*, *or*, *not*, and
*implies*).

* [***Learn the language***]({{< relref "/language-intro.md" >}}) of
Prooftoys, and:

* a simple system of [***practical deduction***]({{< relref
  "/inference.md" >}}).

### **Dive straight in**

* ***Quick start*** is on the **[proof builder]({{< relref
"/proofbuilder.md" >}})** page.

* ***Check out examples*** of ***rigorous proofs***.  You can view all
of the theorems in the system -- both theorems of [**logic**]({{<
relref "/theorems.md" >}}) and [**the real numbers**]({{< relref
"/real-number-facts.md" >}}).  Understand them in detail or just
browse.  The same techniques are available for you to use in the
**[proof builder]({{< relref "/proofbuilder.md" >}})**.

### **Need some reasons?**

**User interface.** Prooftoys works entirely through a Web-based
point-and-click graphical user interface.  You select a step or part
of a step.  Prooftoys offers you suggestions and lets you change your
mind as often as you like, encouraging you to "play around" with your
proofs.

**Simplicity.** The logic used by Prooftoys has also been chosen
specifically for beginners.  For example its rule of inference in
simple situations is just a modest generalization of what is taught in
any high school course in basic algebra.

Statements in the logic are simply formulas with constants, variables,
and functions.  There is no separate concept of hypotheses in the
language, though some simple automation in the inferences gives
similar effects.

* [About the logic]({{< relref "/inference.md" >}})

**Flexibility.** Prooftoys is well-suited to solving problems as well
as proving theorems.  For example it has no special adaptation to
working backward from a theorem statement.

**Familiarity.** Prooftoys makes extra effort to present its
mathematics in familiar, textbook-like style as much as possible.  For
example type conditions are stated as assumptions rather than type
annotations, and the result of division by zero is not a number.

**Transparency.** Prooftoys makes the details of every step in every
proof available in the proof builder and all proof displays.  A click
lets you drill down into the details of any step, to any depth.

**Website.** With this website you can see how it is done or learn
about the ideas behind the logic to build your skills and confidence
in solving mathematical problems through proof.

**Prooftoys is for learning.** If you need more power or larger scale,
you should probably look at some more established proof assistant
systems, which support:

- Large collections of theorems
- Editing entire mathematical theories
- Strong automation

Even the specialized Prooftoys procedures (a.k.a. "tactics") for
working with real numbers are works in progress, not finished
products.

## What is deductive reasoning?

Deductive reasoning starts with true statements, or at least ones
taken as hypothetically true, and follows precise rules to reach
conclusions that we take to be clear consequences of those initial
statements.  Mathematical reasoning, as in mathematical proof, is the
quintessence and the epitome of deductive reasoning.

Much as mathematics is an essential building material for science,
mathematical reasoning is an essential building material for
mathematics, that makes it possible to build sturdy mathematical
structures that reach all the way "**<a target=_blank

beyond!</a>**"

### Why deductive reasoning?

Proof -- deductive reasoning -- is a cornerstone of mathematical
thinking.  So if mathematics applies to something you are trying
to do, you probably need skills in deductive reasoning.

Deductive reasoning is also key to solving a tremendous variety
of problems that can be stated precisely.  The problem could
be practical, or just entertainment for your brain.

The "Mutilated chessboard problem" is a fun one.

Here is a sample, a problem is from the book "My Best Mathematical and
Logic Puzzles" by the legendary <a target=_blank
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner">Martin
Gardner</a>, author of numerous books of entertaining and puzzling
mathematics and, for 25 years, the Mathematical Games column in
Scientific American magazine.

This is problem 20 in the book, a little mathematical parlor trick.
