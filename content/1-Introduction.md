## Introducing Prooftoys

Prooftoys is a visual tool that can run in any web page
to support non-experts in self-education and exploration
of logic and axiomatic mathematical reasoning,
using the real numbers as a starting point.

On the [Prooftoys](http://prooftoys.org/) website
you can study proofs or play around with building your
own.  For example there is a page devoted to proofs of
[facts about real numbers](http://prooftoys.org/real-number-facts.html).
They are elementary and mostly pretty short.

The companion mathtoys.org site
uses the same engine as an assistant for solving basic
high school algebra problems, with ready-made examples
[on this page](http://mathtoys.org/equations.html).

### Reading and learning more

To understand more about what is going on with Prooftoys
proofs and the Prooftoys system, you may want to read more of
this series of Wiki pages.  See the table of contents on the right,
probably starting with [Prooftoys logic concepts](2+Prooftoys+logic+concepts).
