Move on to:

* [**The logic**]({{< relref "/language-intro.md" >}}) of Prooftoys,
and [**logical inference**]({{< relref "/inference.md" >}}).

* _Proofs_ about [**logic**]({{< relref "/theorems.md" >}}) and [**the
real numbers**]({{< relref "/real-number-facts.md" >}}).  Understand
in detail or just browse.

* [**Building your own proofs**]({{< relref "/proofbuilder.md" >}})
with the online _proof builder_.  This tool has some rough edges
still, but don't worry; it will only do correct inferences.

A more finished version of the proof builder
is targeted for solving simple equations, at the
companion [**Mathtoys**](http://mathtoys.org/equations.html) site.
