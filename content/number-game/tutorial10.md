This is the trickiest challenge of our own adventures in reasoning
about addition, and a proper capstone for this adventure.

#### *Congratulations, You Did It!!*

*Notes: this proof needs simplifications with T and F (or
tautologies).  Also it uses some of the less intuitive properties of
the conditional.  And there should probably be a little discussion
about irrelevant assumptions in an earlier page.*

This is officially the end.  There is always a next challenge though,
in life and in mathematics.  In fact one is already prepared here.  Be
warned though, that it needs some proof techniques we have not
explored or explained as yet.
