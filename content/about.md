### About Prooftoys.org

The [Prooftoys](http://prooftoys.org) website and its software are
ongoing experiments in creating computer aids to help human beings do
mathematics.  The application software is proudly open source, hosted
at <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>, primarily in the <a
href="http://github.com/crisperdue/prooftoys">crisperdue/prooftoys</a>
repository.  Our goal is to create computer math tools that are
useful, attractive, and valuable to people learning (or doing)
mathematics at many levels and universally available.

### Getting in touch

One of the goals of this website is to develop a friendly community
of users around the tools here and using computers for mathematical
reasoning.  Feel free to say "hello" to the author through
<a href="mailto:cris@perdues.com"><b>email</b></a>.

<!--
Today there are wonderful tools for practitioners who need answers to
mathematical questions, ranging from handheld calculators to numerical
simulators to computer algebra systems.  Generally speaking, these
tools do not require their users to use proof, though understanding of
mathematical principles can be most helpful to users of these tools,
and proof is a part of the essence of all mathematical principles.

At the same time, mathematical proof is poorly understood by both
students and skilled practitioners of fields that use and even rely on
mathematics.

Prooftoys is an effort to bring deeper and stronger understanding of
mathematical proof to a wider audience, aided by computer
implementation of principles of mathematical proof.

The experience of two or more thousands of years of
mathematical practice has shown that diverse minds from different
backgrounds and different times can agree when a statement has been
mathematically proven according to accepted principles, and when it
has not.
