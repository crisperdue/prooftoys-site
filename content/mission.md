# The Prooftoys mission and vision

## The mission

The Prooftoys project aims to demonstrate how a simplified system of
deductive reasoning can support effective and natural use of proof in
learning mathematics, starting with basic algebra and extending to much
more.

In a broader sense, Prooftoys aims to promote the understanding,
appreciation, and practice of mathematical proof.

## The vision

The practical successes of mathematics and its contributions to all of
the sciences are main reasons for the high regard mathematics has had
at least since the times of the ancient Greeks.  Because mathematical
reasoning is at the core of mathematical thinking, it is key to every
branch of mathematics.

It turns out that the kind of reasoning gently introduced in any basic
algebra course enables the deduction needed for solving many typical
math problems in the sequence of topics from algebra and leading up to
calculus, and more.  Modest though conceptually significant extensions
enable the system to work with much more advanced mathematics.

The Prooftoys effort is based on the idea that with modern technology,
learning to use precise reasoning quite soon after basic algebra has the
potential to help students do mathematics more easily and go beyond
where they otherwise could otherwise go.

### Implementation

The proof builder tool implements the logic with a user-friendly
interface design to help users succeed without having to learn the
details of the logic up front.  The user focuses on a step or part of a
step, and the tool offers next steps specifically relevant to the
focused part.

The content on this website demonstrates the approach, starting with
basic pre-college mathematics and showing how the reasoning extends
naturally to working with more advanced concepts such quantifiers,
functions, and collections.

## Background -- the paradigm today

Procedures. Simple problem-solving.

Generally proof only prominent for math majors taking hardcore theory
classes.  Some proof may show up in discrete math, but then not at a
practical level.

There are courses focused on mathematical reasoning, but not widespread.
"Book of Proof", "Introduction to Mathematical Thinking", etc..
These are good, but at best come into play late in the game.

## Background -- computer and Internet resources (emerging paradigm)

Computers and the Internet already offer wonderful resources for
mathematics in many areas: visualization, demonstrations, developing
intuition, ...

Computers also do mathematical reasoning through formal logic.

Textbooks and curricula lag behind.

## Rationale


Logical reasoning is the bedrock of mathematics.  


Today computers can solve typical textbook problems in algebra, trigonometry,
even calculus easily for us.
