## About Prooftoys

The core of [Mathtoys](http://mathtoys.org) is a Web-based,
visual proof assistant based on [Alonzo Church's 
simple type theory](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-church/)
as developed by 
[Peter Andrews](http://gtps.math.cmu.edu/andrews.html)
under the name [Q<sub>0</sub>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_zero).
Simple type theory is suitable for construction
of most of mathematics, comparable in this respect to first-order
logic plus set theory.  It uses a minimum of
simple, understandable concepts, expressing them with
a handful of axioms and inference rules.

Prooftoys uses a slightly different axiomatization than Q<sub>0</sub>,
and will transition to definitions of boolean operators that
directly expose their truth tables. But the theorems remain the
same as in Q<sub>0</sub>.

The software is highly interactive and delivered to users
through the Web, so they can play with it instantly.

There is a web site with pages for interacting with it
at http://prooftoys.org/.

[Mathtoys](http://mathtoys.org) is an interface to Prooftoys tuned for
working high school algebra problems.

For more information on Church's simple type theory one source is the
[Type Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory) article in
Wikipedia.  [This
description](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-church/#ForBasEqu)
of Andrews' formulation of type theory has more technical detail.

The well-established [HOL family](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOL_theorem_prover)
of theorem provers are also based on simple type theory, though there are
significant differences as well, including major differences in the style
of proofs they are designed to support.

Project task tracking is in
[Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/248279), though
currently much out of date.
