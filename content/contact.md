# Getting in touch

Thank you for visiting Prooftoys.org!

This website is an <a href="/mission/">ongoing experiment</a> with the
goal of making a great experience for people with an interest in
exploring mathematics and and the key idea of mathematics as deductive
reasoning.

## Need help?

If you need help with any of the content here, you have come to the
right place.  In fact, if you have questions or feedback, you are making
an important contribution to the effort.  At this time, the site is
low-volume, and the author is glad to help you out any way that I can.

Probably the easiest way to get in touch is through <a
href="mailto:cris@perdues.com"><b>email</b></a>.

Best regards,<br>
Cris Perdue
