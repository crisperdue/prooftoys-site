# The Prooftoys mission

The Prooftoys project exists to demonstrate how simple and familiar
styles of reasoning combined with computer support can make mathematical
proof easier to grasp.

Modern formal logic with a suitable user interface can make it practical
to start using precise reasoning before college-level mathematics.  And
the style of reasoning extends smoothly to more advanced mathematics.

The information and tools on this website demonstrate the approach,
starting with basic pre-college mathematics and showing how the
reasoning extends naturally to working with more advanced concepts such
quantifiers, functions, collections, and in the end a wide variety of
mathematical objects.

## You might be wondering

**Q:** *You seem to believe that I can "pick up" Prooftoys without a lot
of studying.  Surely you can't be serious??*

**A:** Yes, I am serious!  Try a few of the simplest sample problems and
see how it feels.  You may find that getting simple things done is not
hard at all. The proof builder is designed to get around some key
difficulties of learning logic.  If it falls short, please [contact the
author]({{< relref "/about.md" >}}).  I would love to hear from you.

Properly grasping the meaning of mathematical
statements may take a bit longer.  You can start by ignoring the parts
that aren't shown in a typical textbook, but those parts are important,
too, because they reveal mathematical ideas.

**Q:** *But is it useful for "textbook" math problems?*

**A:** In fact it can help you solve problems quickly and accurately,
but you will need to invest some time in learning to use it and getting
familiar with explicit mathematical reasoning.

**Q:** *Can it help me with my math homework?*

**A:** If you are just trying to get today's homework done today,
Prooftoys is probably not worth the effort.  If you would like help
getting through your homework for the rest of the year, then probably
yes.  Once you get familiar with the basics, the same concepts carry
over directly to new topics in math.

And if you want to strengthen your mathematical skills and your grasp of
mathematical concepts, then Prooftoys should be able to really shine for
you.

**Q:** *Why should I spend time here when there are Khan Academy,
Geogebra, Wolfram Alpha, and many other mathematics help websites?*

**A:** Prooftoys is about mathematical reasoning. The user interface
keeps you always in control while assuring that your reasoning is
mathematically correct.  You solve the problem or prove the theorem
yourself, while the engine correctly takes care of the details. As you
work, presentation of the reasoning is in textbook-like form.

None of these "math help" website offers anything close to this, and to
my knowledge no other math help website is backed by a computer
implementation of mathematical logic.

**Q:** *Is Prooftoys or its logic really that unique?*

**A:** Well, yes and no.  The simple type theory used in Prooftoys has
essentially the same theorems as the logics behind "research-grade"
proof assistants such based on higher-order logic such as HOL4, HOL
Light, Isabelle/HOL, and others.

Some textbooks present first-order logic.  In contrast with first-order
logic, functions, collections, and quantifiers have natural forms of
expression in the language of Prooftoys.  The system works directly with
functions and collections without the need to add set theory.

**Q:** *My interest is learning about mathematical proof using a
textbook such as "The Book of Proof" or similar resource. Why should I
spend my time learning to use Prooftoys instead of learning from a well
thought-out book?*

**A:** You may be very happy with your book.  In fact some of the types
of reasoning steps available in Prooftoys are directly inspired by books
of this kind.  If you are teaching yourself, you may find that Prooftoys
helps to "keep you honest", not skipping steps or waving your hands.
The downside can be that computers and computer implementations of logic
are very precise and explicit, so Prooftoys may feel nit-picky about
some things.

**Q:** Does this "simplicity" accomplish anything?

**A:** Yes, it does.  You see, there are at least two kinds of
simplicity of logics.  One could be called technical simplicity.  How
many axioms are there, and how many rules of inference?  How complicated
are they to describe?

Another kind of simplicity might be called practical simplicity.
Practical simplicity.

A careful look at the most basic textbook algebra shows two ways for
going from one step of work to the next.  Surprisingly, these two ways
carry forward naturally to even quite advanced mathematics.  **No
other** basic rules are needed, and even a great many reasoning steps
used in much higher mathematics are just simple combinations of these
two.

First it is necessary to make these rules precise; not to change them,
but just to make them crystal clear.  To get "off the ground" we also
need to be able to talk about statements as well as numbers.  Up until
calculus, this is all we need to work properly and effectively with
textbook mathematics.

Talking mathematically about statements means having variables and
constants with "boolean" values, values can be "true" or "false"; and
functions with inputs or outputs that can be true or false.  This is the
main adjustment needed for textbook math prior to calculus.

## Background

The pre-college mathematics track from algebra up through calculus is
heavily based on equations.  Most of the mathematical laws presented are
laid out in the form of equations.  Solutions to prototypical textbook
problem -- at least prior to calculus -- revolve around manipulating
equations using these laws.

A careful look at the most basic textbook algebra reveals two ways in
which one step of work follows from another.

**One way** is by replacing *an occurrence* of a variable or expression with
another expression equal to it.  So if we know that `2 + 2 = 4` we can
replace any occurrence of `2 + 2` with `4`.

**The other way** is by substituting any expression at all for *every
occurrence* of a *variable*.

It turns out that equations and these same rules for working with
equations can also neatly apply to much more advanced mathematics as
well.

The information and tools on this website are devoted to showing how to
do this.

On the one hand, it aims to explain these very same few rules more
carefully and systematically.  Then with these as a 

Then with a minimum of extension it shows
how to capture intuitive mathematical thinking as application of the
rules to different kinds of problems.

## Why should I think this way is more effective?




## But I have to learn all of this extra stuff

Mathematics has a practical side.  In fact it has many practical
sides.  Managing your money and other resources is practical.
Planning, designing, and building are practical.  Success using math
in these kinds of situations is a real of success.

Borrowing and lending, investing, and analyzing risk need a bit more

One measure is successfully answering the questions in the textbook and
on your teacher's tests.

Mathematics has proved itself to be a uniquely powerful tool for solving
problems and answering questions.

## Background -- the paradigm today

Procedures. Simple problem-solving.

Generally proof only prominent for math majors taking hardcore theory
classes.  Some proof may show up in discrete math, but then not at a
practical level.

There are courses focused on mathematical reasoning, but not widespread.
"Book of Proof", "Introduction to Mathematical Thinking", etc..
These are good, but at best come into play late in the game.

## Background -- computer and Internet resources (emerging paradigm)

Computers and the Internet already offer wonderful resources for
mathematics in many areas: visualization, demonstrations, developing
intuition, ...

Computers also do mathematical reasoning through formal logic.

Textbooks and curricula lag behind.

## Rationale


Logical reasoning is the bedrock of mathematics.  


Today computers can solve typical textbook problems in algebra, trigonometry,
even calculus easily for us.
