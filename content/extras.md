### Functions

In mathematics a function named `f` is often defined
with a statement like this:

> `f(x) = x + 1`

In our notation we write:

<blockquote>
`(f x) = x + 1`<br>
</blockquote>

or omit the parentheses around the function call, like this:

<blockquote>
`f x = x + 1`<br>
</blockquote>

So:

<blockquote>
`f 0 = 1`<br>
`f 1 = 2`<br>
`f 2 = 3`
</blockquote>

and so on.  A function produces a result value given an input value or
values.  The addition function (`+`) for example
takes two numbers as input and gives a number as its result, as in
`3 + 5 = 8`.  The function `f` above takes a
number as input and produces a number as its result.  The value of a
function can depend only on its inputs, nothing else.  And given the
same inputs on different occasions any mathematical function must have
the same result each time.

A function can have the same result regardless of the input, for
example the function defined by `(f x) = 1`.  A function of
this sort is a <i>constant function</i> because its result does not
vary with different inputs.  But no function can give different
results given the same inputs twice.
