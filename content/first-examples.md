## Tiny examples

Looking at a couple of very small examples shows how to structure
equation-solving and proof in the Prooftoys logic.  Everything is set up
to work entirely with statements that are mathematically known to be
true.  Let's see how to work this way.

### Solving an equation

Mathematically speaking, a full solution of an equation is an
equivalence between the "problem statement" and the solution, often
under some assumptions --- typically that we are interested in solutions
of certain types; often real numbers, as we see here.

Any statement is equivalent to itself --- a basic property of logic ---
and that is often an excellent way to start, with the equation as the
chosen statement.  We do that here.  In the rule menu this is always
available (when no term is selected) as "consider a term to transform".

A couple of extemely useful facts about numbers are `x = y == x + z = y +
z` and `x = y == x - z = y - z`.  In basic algebra it is very common to
"cancel out" a term like the `2` in `x - 2` to remove it from one side
of the equation.



#### About the steps

And so on.

#### Playing around

Feel free to play around with the proof editor, below.  Pressing the
"Solve" button enters the entire proof into the proof builder.  That may
take a moment, so be patient.
