<h1><b><b style="float:right">(Prove It)</b><b>(Yes You Can)</b></b></h1>

Welcome to **Prooftoys**, an online tool for learning math and
exploring mathematical reasoning.  The system and this site lets you
explore these subjects in multiple ways.

- Introduce yourself to basic
  [**logic concepts**](#logic-through-pictures) through pictures.
- Get acquainted with [**the automated logic**](#the-automated-logic)
  used here.
- [**Dig into proofs**](#digging-into-proofs) created and verified
  by Prooftoys.  Understand in detail or just browse.
- Eventually you may choose to experiment with
  [**building your own**](#building-your-own)
  proofs using the interactive proof builder.

The core system is proudly free and open source software, hosted on <a
href="http://github.com/crisperdue/prooftoys" target=_blank>
GitHub</a>.

## Logic through pictures

This site also aims to help you *understand the concepts* at work in
mathematical logic and the Prooftoys system, with interactive
pictures resembling this:

[{{< figure src="/images/logic-circles.png" alt="sample logic graphic"
   width="372" height="122">}}]({{< relref "/logic-pix-intro.md" >}})

- Start [**here**]({{< relref "/logic-pix-intro.md" >}}).


## The automated logic

Prooftoys applies the kind of logic used in several popular
tools for specialists, but presents it with the overriding
goal of being as approachable to beginners as possible, and
to make statements in the language familiar to users of
ordinary math textbooks.  Next steps in this direction -

- [**Concepts**]({{< relref "/2-prooftoys-logic-concepts.md" >}})
  of the Prooftoys logic.
- The logical [**language**]({{< relref "/language-intro.md" >}})
  of Prooftoys.
- The [**rules of the game**]({{< relref "/inference.md" >}})
  as played with Prooftoys.


## Digging into proofs

With Prooftoys you can *view and study completed proofs*. This
website contains "live" displays of many of them, like this:

{{< figure src="/images/site-image.png" alt="sample proof display"
   width="478" height="222">}}

Some are proofs of basic facts about *numbers*, derived from classic
axioms.  Others are useful theorems of *pure logic* that can apply to
any field of math.  You can view the facts and their proofs, which are
all worked out rigorously and computer-verified.  If a step is not
clear, you can "drill down" into the details, all the way down to the
most basic axioms and inferences.

- Proved facts about [**the real numbers**]
  ({{< relref "/real-number-facts.md" >}}).
- Key theorems of [**pure logic**]
  ({{< relref "/logical-axioms-and-theorems.md" >}}).


## Building your own

- For the boldest, dive into *building your own proofs* with the
  [**proof builder**]({{< relref "/proofbuilder.md" >}}).  This tool
  has some rough edges still, though it will only do correct
  inferences.
- For a somewhat more finished version of the proof builder, try
  the version targeted for solving simple equations, at the
  companion [Mathtoys](http://mathtoys.org/) site.
