## Getting a mathematical start

This little essay is here to pose the question, "When starting to learn mathematics, why not do it in a *mathematical* way?" My personal answer to this question is, "Sure, absolutely, why not? Let's do it." Of course, though this question is short, it is not so simple.

What do I mean, "in a *mathematical* way"?

Professor Keith Devlin in his book "Introduction to Mathematical Thinking", starts right off saying:

> For all the time schools devote to the teaching of mathematics, very little (if any) is spent trying to convey just what the subject is about. Instead, the focus is on learning and applying various procedures to solve math problems.

There are a few problems with this state of affairs. As late as the 1950's, NASA relied on and trusted human beings for critical calculations, people hired with *computer* in their job title, as in the movie "Hidden Figures"; but no longer.

These days computers and computer software are very good at applying procedures, including ones to solve math problems. You can enter an integration problem from a college-level calculus course into the https://wolframalpha.com/ website and it will pop out a solution, with graphs, additional information, and even an offer for a step-by-step solution (for paid subscribers), something like this:

Or look at the Wikipedia list of [computer algebra systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computer_algebra_systems) to see a large number of alternatives, both proprietary and open source.

OK, what is that supposed to mean? What would be a mathematical way?

Well, what is mathematics, really? The core of mathematics is deductive thinking, starting from a modest number of general principles, and working out conclusions from them. (Devlin, Mathematical Thinking)
