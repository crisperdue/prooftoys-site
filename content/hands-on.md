# Hands-on with Prooftoys

## Proving

### Simple puzzles and examples

- [**The repetitious number**]({{< relref "/rep-num.md" >}})

  Super-simple puzzle that can be solved with simplification alone.
  Demonstrates setup for a goal-directed proof and use of
  simplification.

- [**Country Music Theorem**]({{< relref "/country-music.md" >}})

  A short goal-directed proof with a full interactive demo walkthrough.
  Uses universal and existential quantification.  A fine starting point
  for working with Prooftoys and goal-directed proof.

- [**The Drinking Theorem**]({{< relref "/drinking.md" >}})

  Sometimes known as the "drinker paradox".  Another goal-directed proof
  using quantifiers.

- [**A Fake Proof**]({{< relref "/fake-proof.md" >}}) that `1 = 2`

  This proof uses simple algebraic manipulations, leading to a result
  that illustrates what fallacious informal reasoning can lead to in a
  system that reasons properly

- **How long is a lunar?** (upcoming)

### Extended Tutorial

- [**The Natural Numbers Game**]({{< relref
  "/number-game/tutorial1.md" >}})

  Extended tutorial that develops some basic propertiess of the natural
  numbers from first principles.  Uses mathematical induction and
  goal-directed proof throughout.  *Note: A simple example such as the
  Country Music Theorem can be an equally good starting point for
  working with Prooftoys, but this tutorial also introduces proof by
  induction and takes you through several proofs.*

#### Tool

- [**Proof builder**]({{< relref "/proofbuilder.md" >}})

## Solving

### Algebra

(work in progress)

Solutions to typical algebra problems --- or solutions to sets of
equations --- are typically mathematical statements equivalent to the
problem statement, but in a simpler or more useful form such as `x =
. . .`.  When solving for multiple variables, the prototypical result is
an "and" that mentions each of those variables, like `x = . . . & y =
. . .`.  If there are multiple solutions, the result is an "or" like `x
= . . . | x = . . .`.

Everything here, from the tactics to the presentation, is not nearly
as polished as the rest of the site, but feel free to take a look.
