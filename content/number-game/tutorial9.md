The conditionals in both directions are true, so you can solve this one
by breaking down the assumed equivalence (`==`) into the two
conditionals.  You have almost reached our final challenge about
addition.

Did you notice that the two conditionals are both axioms?  One of them
is a basic fact of logic, and the other is an axiom about the natural
numbers.
