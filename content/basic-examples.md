# Prooftoys in action

We will start with a few little puzzles where the solutions
demonstrate how Prooftoys operates and how to follow its proofs.

<a name=repetitious-number id=example></a>
## 1. The repetitious number

In this parlor trick you ask spectator A to write down any three-digit
number, then to copy the number to a new piece of paper, followed by
the same digits again, making a six-digit number.  Without looking,
Instruct spectator A to pass the paper to spectator B without
revealing the number to you.

Spectator B is to divide the resulting number by 7, and then pass the
result to a spectator C, who divides the result by 11. (Tell them not
to worry, there will be no remainder!)

C passes it to yet one final spectator.  This last spectator is to
divide the result by 13 and then read the resulting quotient.  The
result will be the original three-digit number.

**Problem:** Prove that this trick always works regardless of the
initially-chosen number.

**Hint:** The key to solving this problem is finding a simple
mathematical statement of it.
