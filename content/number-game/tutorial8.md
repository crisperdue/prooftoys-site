### Adding 1 is the successor

> Step by step one goes far. -- Dutch proverb

To solve this one you will need to remember that the number 1 is
defined to be the successor of 0. It's a nice short proof and a break
from using induction, but you may have to use the "More" menu to find
the fact that `1 = succ 0`, which is our definition of 1.
