## Simple linear equations

All of these have solutions of the usual kind. Solving any kind of equation with one variable consists of transforming the right side of the main equivalence ("`==`").  Each of the ones in this set has a single solution, so the right side will have the form `x = . . . `, where `x` is the equation's variable.

Pressing "Clear work" removes all but the problem statement, and "Solve" generates a pre-made solution. You can still edit the proof after that.

### Linear equation

<div class=proof-editor data-one-doc data-steps=
 "(steps (1 consider
            (t (((4 * ((2 * x) - 3)) + 7) = ((3 * x) + 5)))))"
></div>

### Another linear equation

<div class=proof-editor data-one-doc data-steps=
 "(steps (1 consider (t (8 * (2 - t) = -5 * t))))"
></div>

### Working with fractions

<div class=proof-editor data-one-doc data-steps=
 "(steps (1 consider (t (5 * x - 6 = 2 / 3))))"
></div>

### Common denominators

<div class=proof-editor data-one-doc data-steps=
 "(steps (1 consider (t (((5 * x) - (5 / 4)) = (2 / 3)))))"
></div>
