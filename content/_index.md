## **What is Prooftoys?**

Prooftoys is a set of resources for learning the principles of
_precise reasoning_ -- **logic** and **mathematical proof**, tailored
specifically for beginners with little background in mathematics and
no background in formal logic.  It exists to be an enjoyable and
rewarding road to learning and applying these powerful tools, and
includes an embedded graphical tool that helps you construct
understandable and correct proofs with no holes and no handwaves.

### **Get introduced**

{{% divstyle style="float: right; xmargin: 2em 10% 0 10%" %}}
<a href="{{< relref "/logic-pix-intro.md" >}}">
{{< figure src="/images/logic-circles.png" alt="sample logic graphic"

</a>
{{% /divstyle %}}

* ***Tour [the picture gallery]({{< relref "/logic-pix-intro.md"
>}})*** that introduces basic "boolean" logic.  These are interactive
Venn diagrams with explanation, and truth tables -- a point of view on
"propositional" logic (e.g. *and*, *or*, *not*, and *implies*).

* ***Learn [the language]({{< relref "/language-intro.md" >}})*** of
Prooftoys.

* ***Understand*** its simple, practical, efficient system of
[***deduction***]({{< relref "/inference.md" >}}).

### **Dive straight in**

* ***Quick start*** on the **[proof builder]({{< relref
"/proofbuilder.md" >}})** page.

* ***Check out examples*** of *rigorous proofs*.  You can view all
of the theorems in the system -- both theorems of [**logic**]({{<
relref "/theorems.md" >}}) and [**the real numbers**]({{< relref
"/real-number-facts.md" >}}).  Understand them in detail or just
browse.  The same techniques are available for you to use in the
**[proof builder]({{< relref "/proofbuilder.md" >}})**.

### **Need some reasons?**

**User interface.** Prooftoys works entirely through a Web-based
point-and-click graphical user interface.  You select a step or part
of a step.  Prooftoys offers you suggestions and lets you change your
mind as often as you like, encouraging you to "play around" with your
proofs.  If used well, suggestions benefit from recognition being
easier than recall.

**Simplicity.** The logic used by Prooftoys has also been chosen
specifically for beginners.  For example its single rule of inference
is just a modest generalization of what is taught in any high school
course in basic algebra.

Statements in the logic are simply formulas with constants, variables,
and functions.  Prooftoys reduces the number of concepts to a minimum,
with just a little automation for convenience.  There is no need to
learn a separate proof language with its own syntax and vocabulary.

**Flexibility.** Prooftoys is as well-suited to solving problems as to
proving theorems.  For example it easily works backward from the
statement of a theorem or forward from the givens of a problem.

**Familiarity.** Prooftoys works to present its mathematics in
familiar, textbook-like style.  For example type conditions are stated
as assumptions rather than type annotations, and the result of
division by zero is not a number.  Proofs show up in a familiar
textbook style as a list of proved statements, each derived from the
ones before it.

**Transparency.** Prooftoys makes the details of every step in every
proof available in the proof builder and all proof displays.  A click
lets you drill down into the details of any step, to any depth.

**Resources.** With this website you can see how it is done or learn
about the ideas behind the logic to build your skills and confidence
in solving mathematical problems through proof.

**Prooftoys is for learning.** If you need more power or larger scale,
you should look at more established proof assistant systems, which
support:

- Large collections of theorems
- Editing entire mathematical theories
- Strong automation

The [Prooftoys](http://prooftoys.org) website and its software are
ongoing experiments in creating computer aids to help human beings do
mathematics.  Its knowledge of mathematics is quite limited, but we
aim to grow it as users become more advanced and ask for more.

Even the specialized Prooftoys procedures (a.k.a. "tactics") for
working with real numbers are works in progress, not finished
products.

## What is deductive reasoning?

Deductive reasoning starts with true statements, or at least ones
taken as hypothetically true, and follows precise rules to reach
conclusions that we take to be clear consequences of those initial
statements.  Mathematical reasoning, as in mathematical proof, is the
quintessence and the epitome of deductive reasoning.

Much as mathematics is an essential building material for science,
mathematical reasoning is an essential building material for
mathematics, that makes it possible to build sturdy mathematical
structures that reach all the way "**<a target=_blank

beyond!</a>**"

### Why deductive reasoning?

Proof -- deductive reasoning -- is a cornerstone of mathematical
thinking.  So if mathematics applies to something you are trying
to do, you probably need skills in deductive reasoning.

Deductive reasoning is also key to solving a tremendous variety
of problems that can be stated precisely.  The problem could
be practical, or just entertainment for your brain.

The "Mutilated chessboard problem" is a fun one.

Here is a sample, a problem is from the book "My Best Mathematical and
Logic Puzzles" by the legendary <a target=_blank
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner">Martin
Gardner</a>, author of numerous books of entertaining and puzzling
mathematics and, for 25 years, the Mathematical Games column in
Scientific American magazine.

This is problem 20 in the book, a little mathematical parlor trick.
