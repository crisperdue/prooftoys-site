Move on to:

* [**The logic**]({{< relref "/language-intro.md" >}}) of Prooftoys,
and [**logical inference**]({{< relref "/inference.md" >}}).

* _Proofs_ about [**logic**]({{< relref "/theorems.md" >}}) and [**the
real numbers**]({{< relref "/real-number-facts.md" >}}).  Understand
in detail or just browse.

* Even _build your own proofs_ with the online [**proof
builder**]({{< relref "/proofbuilder.md" >}}).  This tool has some
rough edges still, but don't worry; it will only do correct
inferences.

A more finished version of the proof builder
is targeted for solving simple equations, at the
companion [**Mathtoys**](http://mathtoys.org/equations.html) site.
