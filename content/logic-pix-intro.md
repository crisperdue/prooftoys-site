# Logic through pictures - introduction

## Introduction

This page is about fundamental building blocks of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_logic" target=_blank>
classical logic</a> -- *true*, *false*, and functions that
have these values as inputs and outputs.  We will focus on the
functions *and*, *or*, *not*, and *implies*.

These pages use pictures of mathematical worlds or universes that have
things in them.  The things can have properties.  A property is
something like being red, being new, or being a member of some group.
Numbers can have properties such as being even, odd, positive, or
prime.  In classical logic, a thing either has a particular property
or it does not, and there is no middle ground.

The logic concepts described here through pictures are enough to make
precise virtually all of the reasoning needed by students of high
school algebra and trigonometry. (Calculus needs a bit more.)  Adding
suitable rules of inference and axioms for logic and numbers gives a
precise system that can be used to solve a great many math problems at
this level.

This is also the kind of logic used in the Prooftoys proof builder.

### About the pictures

In the pictures a mathematical world is shown as a circle.  The world
has various things in it, each of those things having a particular
spot in the picture.

Mathematical writing, instead of saying a point of a picture is blue,
or has the property of being blue, often says it is a member of the
set of points that are blue.  In mathematics, properties are also
often referred to as *predicates*.  These are all just different
ways of describing the same situation.  (A predicate can also
express a relationship between two or more things, as in
`x < y`.  A predicate like `<` is also commonly called a *relation*, because it expresses a *relationship* between `x` and `y`.)

Collections of things with some common property are shown as a circle, part
of a circle, or other region of this world, shaded with a particular
color or pattern.  Each set is labeled with a name.  Each contains the
things inside its shaded circle or part circle, but nothing ouside of
that.  In the diagrams below, areas where some statement is true are
generally colored.  Areas where a statement is *not true* are
usually white or gray.

In our version of mathematical notation we are going to write
`(green x)` to mean that x is green,
`(blue x)` to mean that x is blue, and so on.

Some of the pictures are near tables that define key functions.
Moving the mouse over one of these pictures or touching it on a touch
screen will cause the relevant table entries to highlight themselves.
