Introduce yourself to the _language_ of [**the automated logic**]({{<
relref "/language-intro.md" >}}) of Prooftoys.

Dig into _proofs_ about [**the real numbers**]({{< relref
"/real-number-facts.md" >}}).  Understand in detail or just browse.
Or facts of [**pure logic**]({{< relref "/logic-facts.md" >}}).

Dive into _building your own proofs_ with the online
[**proof builder**]({{< relref "/proofbuilder.md" >}}).  This tool
has some rough edges still, though it will only do correct
inferences.

A more finished version of the proof builder
is targeted for solving simple equations, at the
companion [**Mathtoys**](http://mathtoys.org/equations.html) site.
