#### Algebra (preview!)

Solutions to typical algebra problems --- or solutions to sets of
equations --- are typically mathematical statements equivalent to the
problem statement, but in a simpler or more useful form such as `x =
. . .`.  When solving for multiple variables, the prototypical result is
an "and" that mentions each of those variables, like `x = . . . & y =
. . .`.  If there are multiple solutions, the result is an "or" like `x
= . . . | x = . . .`.

Everything here, from the tactics to the presentation, is not nearly
as polished as the rest of the site, but feel free to take a look.
