# The Prooftoys Mission

(draft)

The Prooftoys project is an effort to show that formal reasoning with
computer support can be a key part of a more successful and rewarding
approach to learning mathematics.

## Background -- the paradigm today

Procedures. Simple problem-solving.

Generally proof only prominent for math majors taking hardcore theory
classes.  Some proof may show up in discrete math, but then not at a
practical level.

There are courses focused on mathematical reasoning, but not widespread.
"Book of Proof", "Introduction to Mathematical Thinking", etc..
These are good, but at best come into play late in the game.

## Background -- computer and Internet resources (emerging paradigm)

Computers and the Internet already offer wonderful resources for
mathematics in many areas: visualization, demonstrations, developing
intuition, ...

Computers also do mathematical reasoning through formal logic.

Textbooks and curricula lag behind.

## Rationale


Logical reasoning is the bedrock of mathematics.  


Today computers can solve typical textbook problems in algebra, trigonometry,
even calculus easily for us.
