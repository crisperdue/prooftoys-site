1 Linear equation
<div class=proof-editor data-one-doc data-steps=
 "(steps (1 consider
            (t (((4 * ((2 * x) - 3)) + 7) = ((3 * x) + 5)))))"
></div>

2 Another linear equation
<div class=proof-editor data-one-doc data-steps=
 "(steps (1 consider (t (8 * (2 - t) = -5 * t))))"
></div>

3 Working with fractions
<div class=proof-editor data-one-doc data-steps=
 "(steps (1 consider (t (5 * x - 6 = 2 / 3))))"
></div>

4 Common denominators
<div class=proof-editor data-one-doc data-steps=
 "(steps (1 consider (t (((5 * x) - (5 / 4)) = (2 / 3)))))"
></div>
