# Questions and answers



**Q: What makes you think it is worthwhile to be so formal about
reasoning?**

**A:** This question is worth a longer answer, but here is my point of
view in brief.

- Mathematical reasoning is a skill that carries over beyond
  standard techniques.  It is essential to reading explanations produced
  by a computer.  Along with mathematical intuition, it gives you the
  potential to solve different kinds of problems and create new
  mathematical knowledge.  These things will be relevant as long as
  human beings are involved in mathematics.
- Proper computer reasoning is necessarily precise and formal.  It comes
  with some big benefits such as smart tools that give reliable results.

**Q: Can principles of basic algebra really handle advanced
mathematics?**

A: The power of simple principles to solve complex problems is part of
the wonder of mathematics.  In fact Prooftoys does employ just a
couple of simple *extensions* to basic algebra, but mostly it
applies the same principles from algebra in more general ways.

**Q: Do you seriously think I can "pick up" Prooftoys without a lot
of studying?**

**A:** Yes, seriously!  Try a few of the simplest sample problems and
see how it feels.  You may find that getting simple things done is not
hard at all. You can use the proof builder without understanding a lot
about logic.  If it fails in this, please [contact the author]({{<
relref "/about.md" >}}).  I would love to hear from you.

Properly grasping the meaning of mathematical statements may take a bit
longer.  You can start by ignoring the parts that aren't shown in a
typical textbook.  As you understand the language of mathematics better
you can pay more attention to them. 

**Q: But is it useful for "textbook" math problems?**

**A:** In fact it can help you solve problems quickly and accurately,
but you will need to invest some time in learning to use it and getting
familiar with explicit mathematical reasoning.

**Q: Can it help me with my math homework?**

**A:** If you are just trying to get today's homework done today,
Prooftoys is probably not worth the effort.  If you would like help
getting through your homework for the rest of the year, then perhaps
yes.  Once you get familiar with the basics, the same concepts carry
over directly to other topics.
And if you want to strengthen your mathematical skills and your grasp of
mathematical concepts, then Prooftoys should be able to really shine for
you.

**Q: Please don't tell me you want to change the mathematics curriculum.**

**A:** No, I believe that changes to the curriculum can only occur in
the event of overwhelming demand for change, and then only with much
pain.  This project only aims to give some people the chance to try a
fresh approach and hopefully to help point a way forward.

**Q: Why should I spend time here when there are Khan Academy,
Geogebra, Wolfram Alpha, and many other mathematics websites?**

**A:** Prooftoys is about mathematical reasoning. The user interface
keeps you always in control while assuring that your reasoning is
mathematically correct.  You solve the problem or prove the theorem
yourself, while the engine correctly takes care of the details. As you
work, presentation of the reasoning is in textbook-like form.

None of these "math help" website offers this, and to my knowledge no
other math help website is backed by a computer implementation of
mathematical logic.

**Q: Is Prooftoys or its logic really that unique?**

**A:** Well, yes and no.  Very close relatives of the simple type
theory used here are implemented in "research-grade" proof assistant
software, but hardly any textbooks present this kind of logic.

First-order logic is presented in many textbooks. Simple type theory has
important practical and technical advantages, and Prooftoys combines
them with a modern point-and-click user interface.

**Q: My interest is learning about mathematical proof using a
textbook such as "The Book of Proof" or similar resource. Why shouldn't
I learn about proof from my well thought-out book?**

**A:** You may be very happy with your book.  In fact, support for
reasoning in the style of books of this kind is an important goal for
Prooftoys and the proof builder.

If you are teaching yourself, you may find that Prooftoys helps to "keep
you honest", not skipping steps or waving your hands. The downside can
be that computers and computer implementations of logic are very precise
and explicit, so Prooftoys may feel nit-picky at times.

**Q: Tell me more about this type theory.**

A: See the [technical notes]({{< relref "/tech-notes.md" >}}) for
more information about type theory and Prooftoys' use of it.

**Q: Where is the set theory?**

A: Like many modern proof assistants, Prooftoys is based on *simple type
theory* rather than set theory.  Type theory enables us to get on very
directly to talk about things like numbers without theorizing about
sets first.

**Q: Is there something weird about this logic?  When I look at
theorems with quantifiers for example, I see things like `forall P`.
What's up with that?**

A: No, the principles behind Prooftoys are about as standard as can
be.  The notation is sometimes a bit different though.  Anywhere you
see something like `forall P` you can read it exactly as `forall
x. P x` in a more traditional notation.

**Q:** Does this "simplicity" accomplish anything?

**A:** Yes, it does.  You see, there are at least two kinds of
simplicity of logics.  One could be called technical simplicity.  How
many axioms are there, and how many rules of inference?  How complicated
are they to describe?

Another kind of simplicity might be called practical simplicity.
Practical simplicity.

A careful look at the most basic textbook algebra shows two ways for
going from one step of work to the next.  Surprisingly, these two ways
carry forward naturally to even quite advanced mathematics.  **No
other** basic rules are needed, and even a great many reasoning steps
used in much higher mathematics are just simple combinations of these
two.

First it is necessary to make these rules precise; not to change them,
but just to make them crystal clear.  To get "off the ground" we also
need to be able to talk about statements as well as numbers.  Up until
calculus, this is all we need to work properly and effectively with
textbook mathematics.

Talking mathematically about statements means having variables and
constants with "boolean" values, values can be "true" or "false"; and
functions with inputs or outputs that can be true or false.  This is the
main adjustment needed for textbook math prior to calculus.

## Background

The pre-college mathematics track from algebra up through calculus is
heavily based on equations.  Most of the mathematical laws presented are
laid out in the form of equations.  Solutions to prototypical textbook
problem -- at least prior to calculus -- revolve around manipulating
equations using these laws.

A careful look at the most basic textbook algebra reveals two ways in
which one step of work follows from another.

**One way** is by replacing *an occurrence* of a variable or expression with
another expression equal to it.  So if we know that `2 + 2 = 4` we can
replace any occurrence of `2 + 2` with `4`.

**The other way** is by substituting any expression at all for *every
occurrence* of a *variable*.

It turns out that equations and these same rules for working with
equations can also neatly apply to much more advanced mathematics as
well.

The information and tools on this website are devoted to showing how to
do this.

On the one hand, it aims to explain these very same few rules more
carefully and systematically.  Then with these as a 

Then with a minimum of extension it shows
how to capture intuitive mathematical thinking as application of the
rules to different kinds of problems.

Mathematics has a practical side.  In fact it has many practical
sides.  Managing your money and other resources is practical.
Planning, designing, and building are practical.  Success using math
in these kinds of situations is a real of success.
