  What is new and upcoming with Prooftoys
---

### News

##### 07/2024

- Fix the induction axioms to properly require an internal quantifier.
- To this end, support subgoals in the rules and displays so proofs
  remain very similar to what they were before.  Update existing
  proofs accordingly.

##### 05/2024

- New "detach" inference rule.  Selecting the conclusion of a step
  searches for facts with assumptions it matches.  The rule
  substitutes into the fact, then removes it as true.

##### 09/2023

- New "[**Fake Proof**]({{< relref "/fake-proof.md" >}})" of `1 = 2`
- New "[**Drinking Theorem**]({{< relref "/drinking.md" >}})"
- New demonstrations of equation-solving with Prooftoys,
  links in the "[**Hands-on**]({{< relref "/hands-on.md" >}})" page.

##### 07/2023

- Focus on stable and predictable operations so proofs remain
  completely valid as the implementation changes.
- Extensive work on indenting proof steps for clarity and
  easy reading.

##### 04/2023

- [***Natural Numbers Game***]({{< relref "/number-game/tutorial1.md"
 >}}) extensive hands-on tutorial

### Upcoming

- Initial versions of other tasty example proofs, in the
  [hands-on]({{< relref "/hands-on.md" >}}) section of the site.
- Tidy up solutions for linear equations of 1 and 2 variables
